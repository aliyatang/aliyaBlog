    "Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word contains only capital letters and has a length known to the player. A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the hidden word.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.\n",

    "If the letter in the guess is...\n",
    "- Also in the same position in the hidden word -> hint: matching letter\n",
