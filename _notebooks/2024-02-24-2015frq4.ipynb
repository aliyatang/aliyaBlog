    "The specific type of FRQ 4 is methods and control structures. It implements polymorphism through the NumberGroup interface and classes, where each of these classes has to implement the contains method. The Range class implements te NumberGroup interface directly for a range with a constructor initlizaing a min and a max, and contains method checks if a number is in that range. The MultipleGroups class holds the list of NumberGroup Objects where a MultiplGroups instance can contain multiple different number groups. The contains method here iterates through each group to check if the specified number is within the range. "
