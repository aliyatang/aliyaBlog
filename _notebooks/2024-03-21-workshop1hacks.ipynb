    "\n",
    "(a) Define primitive types and reference types in Java. Provide examples of each.\n",
    "- primitive types store actual values, exactly one value of its declared type at a time. value initialized (0 or false). for example, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean\n",
    "- reference types store loaction of object in computer's memory, work with reference of an object not the actual object. for example class, interface, and array\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Explain the differences between primitive types and reference types in terms of memory allocation and usage in Java programs.\n",
    "- primitive types are allocated space directly on stack, memory for short term variables. the stack memory is last in, first out, efficient but not much size \n",
    "- reference types are allocated memory in the heap, large for memory for dynamic allocation. object is placed into heap, and reference to that object is put in the stack. the variable in the stack references the object in the heap. this is less efficient than just directly accessing the stack like with primitive types. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Code:\n",
    "You have a method calculateInterest that takes a primitive double type representing the principal amount and a reference type Customer representing the customer information. Write the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code."
