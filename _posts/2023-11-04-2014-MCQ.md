# Things I searched while taking the quiz:
- Java Math random() Method (Q18): returns a pseudorandom double type number greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0
- Difference between length and size Java: length is for Java array, size is for Java ArrayList collection object
- What does Java substring a to b do (Q23): returns a string including character a, up to but NOT including character b


Questions I struggled on: Q16
