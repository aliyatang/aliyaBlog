# Score: 39/39

# Things I searched while taking the quiz
- Does substring end with the endIndex (Q21): substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) : The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1
- for each loop syntax java (Q22)
- What is compile-time error (Q24): error when code violates syntax rules
- does IInteger.MIN_VALUE find minimum value in java array (Q33): YES

# Problems I struggled on
- The result of executed code segment problems such as Q2: SEE NOTE FOR ADDITIONAL INSIGHT
![Q2](/assets/img/2015-MCQ-Q2.png)
These include a lot of: 
- Practice topic 4.4 (Nested Iteration): Refer to [Lesson 4]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/U4-Iteration/)

### Q21
![Q21](/assets/img/2015-MCQ-Q21.png)
Almost got tricked because I forgot that substring doesn't include the endIndex. Found this out when I searched it up online.  
- Practice topic 10.1 (Recursion): Refer to [Lesson 10]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/U10-Recursion/)

### Q26
![Q26](/assets/img/2015-MCQ-Q26.png)
Gotta be careful here... none of variables in start method are modified [by changeIt] after they are defined. 
- Practice topic 5.6 (Writing Methods): Refer to [Lesson 5]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/U5-Classes/)

# Additional note / things to improve
The way I figure out result of executed code segment problems is very inefficient, right now I write everything down in my notes app or on a paper to keep track of every value through every loop. It works well to keep values organized and know what loop you are on, but it very time consuming. Is there a faster way to figure something out besides doing this? Possibly finding patterns in the loops instead of just recording every value so the process can go faster? I also should just review some of the basic syntax as a refresher before the test, like for each, substring, etc.
