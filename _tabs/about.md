## Aliya's GitHub Page
Hi, I'm Aliya and I'm a junior at Del Norte High School. I'm interested in studying computer science or data science in the future, so I'm excited to see what another year of code code code has to bring us. Outside of academics, I like to cook, paint, and spend time with friends and family.
